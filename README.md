Here is my personal repository of home baked profiles for volatility that I have used in CTFs


Each profile comes with:
- the `.zip` to be added to the volitility plugins folder
- the `version_info.txt` containing output of `lsb_release -a` and `cat /proc/version` (subject to change)
- in most cases, the `kernel-devel-X.X.X` package used to `Make` the dwarf dump
- a `readme`
